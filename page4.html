		<pre style="line-height: 25px">
In the previous lession, we discussed about the different modes.
So in this lession, we will dicuss about the normal mode.
But before diving in, let's see what is the Normal Mode.

<h3 style="text-decoration: underline; ">What is Normal Mode?</h3>Normal mode is the most important mode in vim.
It is the mode we need to be in to switch to other modes.
When we first open up vim, this is the mode we are in by default.

<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Commands in the Normal Mode</h3>Now each mode has its own set of Commands/Key-Bindings.
But here we will discuss about the most commonly used Commands/Key-Bindings in the normal mode.
Here is the list of commands that we will be covering:
<ul style="margin: 0; line-height: 10px;">
	<li>dd</li>
	<li>u</li>
	<li>yy</li>
	<li>D</li>
	<li>S</li>
	<li>caw</li>
	<li>daw</li>
	<li>&lt;n&gt;&lt;c&gt;</li>
</ul>
We will go over all of these commands one by one.
<b style="color: gold;">WARNING: ANY OF THESE COMMANDS USED IN WRONG CASE CAN LEAD TO MISBEHAVIOUR, SO PAY ATTENTION TO THE IT!</b>

<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Command: dd</h3>This command is used for deleting the line our cursor is currently at!
For example, let's say we had a file with the following content ("&lt;c&gt;" indicates our cursor):
"
I 
dummsadfsadt&lt;c&gt;
Love
Mechanical
Keyboards
".
Now the line our cursor is at has to be removed to form a meaningful sentence.
For that we can just do "dd" to delete that whole line instead of smashing the backspace key!

<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Command: u</h3>This command is used to undo something that you have done! It is like Ctrl+z on windows. 
For example lets say we had a file with the following content, text between "&lt;u&gt;" and "&lt;/u&gt;" indicates the change to be undone:
"
Some random dude wrote down this file.
So we have to definitely &lt;u&gt;delete&lt;/u&gt; this file
".
Now we can undo the word "delete" by simply pressing u instead of manually deleting it.

<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Command: yy</h3>This command is used to copy the line our cursor is at.
For example lets say we was in line four in this file:
"
basdfkhsf
aslidfkljsdf
klsjdfkljasdf
some random content
sdlfjljsdf
".
Now to copy this whole line we can just do yy.

<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Command: D</h3>This command is very similar to the dd command, but the key difference is that dd deletes the whole current line no matter where we are in the line.
But D deletes only till the end of the line, from where our cursor is in the current line.
For example in the line "this is my songzozoz", if our cursor was in the first occurrence of the letter z,
we can do D to delete the text "zozoz" to form a meaningful sentence.

<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Command: S</h3>This command is very similar to the dd command, 
except S enters the insert mode after deletding the line while dd doesn't.
(Didn't find an example for this one because we did not cover the insert mode yetü§£ü§£!)

<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Command: caw</h3>This command is used to delete a word we are currently in and then get into the insert mode.
(Didn't find an example for this one too because we did not cover the insert mode yetü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è!)

<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Command: daw</h3>This command is also used to delete a word, 
but the difference is that the caw command gets us into the insert mode after deleting a word, while this command doesn't.
For example, in this line(&lt;cursor&gt; indicates out cursor position) "Vim is asjdfk&lt;cursor&gt;lajsdfkl superior",
To remove the word our cursor is currently in, we can just do daw instead of doing it manually.
